      <description>Introduction I had to work on a PE for reverse engineering for a few weeks, the PE using an extensive amount of encryption/decryption of memory fragments to make it harder to reverse engineer it. However, that PE is for another time. But I had to write a manual encrypter/decrypter for those memory fragments to be able to patch some specific parts without changing instructions size and then crypting those bytes and replacing those specific memory fragments.</description>
