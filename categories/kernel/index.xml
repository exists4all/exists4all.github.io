      <description>In this tutorial we are going to create a static disk drive serial number spoofer. This project will be a little long and need some basic knowledge about operation systems and reverse engineering. We are going to use visual studio community, IDA and windbg and I used windows 11 enterprise.&#xA;The first step is to find out how windows get that information. By googling you can see easily you have to use wmic commands.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my kernel programming tutorial document. Be sure to read these notes before starting.&#xA;Kernel programming is not anything like user mode programming, information about its structure is very limited and most of the time you have to dig very deep into MSDN documentation to understand where you need to start.&#xA;Kernel mode codes have to be perfect, any flaw in them will cause serious problems and most of the time lead to BSOD ( blue screen of death) if they are not treated perfectly.</description>
